title: What If Aliens Tried to Model Earth at Night

Imagine there was an alien civilization, where each individual was as big as a galaxy. For them our planet would have been a tiny microbe.

Suppose the alien civilization did some observing and found a tiny class of Planets in their world, which tend to light up when the Star nearby is not shining. There is this yellowish pattern that emerges on the dark side of these Planets, which is the same every time. After observing for a number of spins, one of these Planets – Earth,–  they come up with a theory. The hypothesis is that it is some sort of condensed gas. A model is proposed that shows a high degree of accuracy in predicting future observations. The gas itself is named Earthon – a luminous gas that absorbs the energy during the day, then at night condenses and starts emitting light.

After numerous more photographs of the Earth, a peculiar thing is noticed – every time the Planet completes a single spin around the Star nearby, the pattern of light is slightly altered for a single revolution. Something that before was written off as a measurement error, is now widely accepted as an actual phenomenon. The old theory is lacking, so a new theory is proposed. The new theory improves on the old one, by introducing this periodic alteration. The model is considered a great success, because it can predict the phenomenon to two additional decimal points.

The new theory works so great, at some point it is hard to find any skeptics. The scientific consensus is that they pretty much “nailed it”. The day the last skeptic dies, an observation is made, that Earth exerted a short burst of light on its bright side, something it has not done before! Another two bright bursts were quickly followed in a different location this time. After 10 or so more spins, the frequency of these bursts just explodes in a _nuclear_ fashion. The scientific world of our alien civilization finds itself in a dire need for a new theory; maybe a new type of gas would work?
